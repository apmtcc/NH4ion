# NH4ion  
Subroutine POT to compute (H2) + (NH2-) potential energy for a given geometry
Atom order : H--H--H--H--N
Units for  : Cartesian in Angstrom and energy in eV
Total 45932 CCSD(T)/F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ points fitted by FI-NN method
Fitting RMSE= 5.0307meV, which is average of 2 PESs 
Update by Mengyi Pan
Subroutine "PREPOT" must be called only once before "POT"
The data file 'PARA.txt' and 'W0**.txt' should be in the same directory as the program
